This project was used to demo using NPM and Node

The aim of the application is to take the argument submitted by the user when running the code and returning the language of the argument.
For example, as shown in the picture, if the user added the argument "hallo icha bin Juergen wi gehts", then the output would be German.

The packages used here are "franc" to determine the language of the input and "langs" to convert the language code returned from franc into the full language name.
